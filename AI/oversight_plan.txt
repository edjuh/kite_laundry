# Oversight Plan for Kite Laundry Design Generator
# Created: October 26, 2025, 9:41 PM CET by Grok 3 (xAI)
# Purpose: Guide PARR (Plan-Act-Review-Repeat) from user request to MVP, with issue prevention.
# Maintained by: User (ed) via Git commits.

## Project Overview
- Purpose: Web tool for kite laundry design (tails, drogues), education, tracking.
- Use: Hobbyists, education, personal management; beginners, simple UI.
- Core: Start (units), Select (type), Configure (inputs), Output (SVG/text), Designs (list).
- DB: SQLite (name, type, dimensions, colors, rod, creation_date).
- Future: Costs, PDF/DXF, API, 3D (Q1 2026).

## Modules
- Main: Start/Select.
- Design: Configure/Output.
- DB: SQLite.
- Render: SVG/PDF.

## Model Evolution
- MVP: JSON dict (dimensions, colors).
- Phase 1: Add unit_label, validation.
- Phase 2: Add material_cost, exports.
- Phase 3: Add 3D, user_id.

## Planning (PARR)
- Plan: One step/response, reasoned (e.g., Step 1: Directory).
- Act: Execute, commit.
- Review: User validates, AI checks Git.
- Repeat: Next step per feedback.
- Steps: 1. Directory (done), 2. Requirements (done), 3. Config (done), 4. App structure (done), 5. Design routes (done), 6. Rendering (done), 7. Pages (done), 8. Test (in progress).

## Verification
- Pre: Simulate in Python 3.x, validate files.
- Post: Git review, user logs.
- Errors: Try-except, logging.

## Issues to Avoid
- **Zsh Parse Errors**: Repeated due to unquoted `[ ]` in conditionals. Fix: Use escaped `\[ \]` or `if` statements, test in zsh 5.9.
- **File Truncation**: README.md cut off (e.g., smiley issues). Fix: Validate full text before commit.
- **Step Numbering**: Inconsistencies (e.g., skipped 6). Fix: Align with plan, double-check sequence.
- **Positive Language**: Overuse despite requests to avoid. Fix: Use neutral tone, reflect user mood.
- **Modularity**: Monolithic root. Fix: Enforce `app/`, `models/`, etc.

## Triggers
- Markers: "Oversight Marker:..." in files.
- Review: User commits trigger PARR.
- Reset: Revert to [0f1ab6b], call "PARR Review".

## Log
- Verified: October 26, 2025, 9:41 PM CET.
- Next: After Step 8 commit.

# User maintains via Git. Call "PARR Review" to reset.
