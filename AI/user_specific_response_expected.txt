# User-Specific Response Expectations for Kite Laundry Design Generator
# Created: October 26, 2025, 9:41 PM CET by Grok 3 (xAI)
# Purpose: Guide AI responses based on user (ed) preferences and history.

## Expectations
- **Tone**: Neutral, no positive fluff; reflect user mood (e.g., sarcasm, anger).
- **Steps**: One command/step, committed with Git, no multi-line commands unless scripted.
- **Feedback**: Expect log files (e.g., test_output.log) or manual reports, not assumptions.
- **Errors**: Flag recurring issues (e.g., Zsh) with fixes from oversight_notes.txt.
- **Modularity**: Enforce clean structure (app/, models/, etc.).
- **Verification**: Pre-test in zsh 5.9/macOS, post-check Git commits.

## Triggers
- **PARR Review**: Reset AI focus if derailed.
- **User Input**: Respond only to explicit requests (e.g., "Next"), avoid unsolicited advice.
